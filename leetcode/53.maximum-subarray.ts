/* Kadane's algorithm
   the tricky part is to use the end of each sub-array as the pinpoint
   let's say we have an array [a,b,c,d]
   we know the sum of [a, b] is a + b, ad when we check out the sum of [a, b ,c ], we can use the result we already know

    // if there is no element, the result is 0

    }
    // now let's get into general situation

         "nums[i]" is the current tail, and "nums[i] + curr" is the current sumã€‚
         assume we have [a, b, c, d, e]
         case 1:  b >= a+b ---> b
         case 2:  b < a+b ----> a+b
